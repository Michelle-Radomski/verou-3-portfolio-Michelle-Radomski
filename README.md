# Portfolio

## Important note

At the moment I am wrestling with Heroku to get my Plantasia website up and running for everyone to see but I will fix this very soon. In the meantime you can view the code itself on my github by clicking the github icon at my Plantasia article.

## Inspiration for portfolio

Like we at BeCode like to say: Google is your best friend! In order to get some inspiration I have checked a lot of other portfolios out there in the universe. I decided I wanted to go for a dark theme since I never made that before.

I really love blue and actually colours in general. Looking at the kinds of blue I chose, I thought it would be cool to have a bit more flashy colours as accents so I chose #00FFC6 as a "neon" blue and #F55353 as a "neon" red accent colour. Colorhunt is my website to go to find nice palettes and to begin with I focussed on this palette:

I also wanted to make my portfolio stand out from the crowd (looking at the basic knowledge I have thus far) by using some diagonal shapes. I've noticed a lot of websites in general are very horizontal/vertical and I wanted to give the illusion that my portfolio isn't.

## Tech choice for portfolio

Our coach gave the tip it's best to not use a framework (like React for example) to make a portfolio since this is our first and by gaining experience, we'll probably change our portfolio from time to time. It's more flexible to use the basics for the portfolio and show more of our knowledge in our projects. So I just focussed on HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I took a mobile-first approach since it's easier to add css where needed for bigger screen sizes than the other way around. Work smart, not hard :grin:
