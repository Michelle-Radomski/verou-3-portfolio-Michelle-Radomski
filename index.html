            <p>a junior full stack web developer who likes to express herself in many (creative) ways. I was looking for a nice balance between
                creativity and logic. It's not surprising I found that in web development. Thanks to BeCode I kickstarted my training and career
                and now I'm ready for new adventures!

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>You could say I'm a jack of all trades. Whoever said curiosity killed the cat was wrong! I see it as an opportunity to know more 
                about something foreign or new. It's an experience. I look the same way at code. There's always something interesting to find out!
            </p><br>
            <p>Being tired of jobs that just seemed to ignore my brain it was time for a career switch. So I did. No regrets. Changing direction is
                the normal flow of life. We're not static, we move in many ways and that's what brings us to new, fantastic places!
            </p><br>
            <p>Although I'm a rookie you should not forget: what I lack in experience I will make up for with my enthousiasm!</p>
