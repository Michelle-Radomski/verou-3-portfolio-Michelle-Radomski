                <p>a junior full stack web developer who likes to express herself in many (creative) ways. Thanks to BeCode I kickstarted my training and career
                    and now I'm ready for new adventures!

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>You could say I'm a jack of all trades. Whoever said curiosity killed the cat was wrong! I see it as an opportunity to know more 
                    about something foreign or new. It's an experience. I look the same way at code. There's always something interesting to find out!
                </p><br>
                <p>Being tired of jobs that just seemed to ignore my brain it was time for a career switch. I was looking for a nice balance between
                    creativity and logic. It's not surprising I found that in web development. Changing direction is
                    the normal flow of life. We're not static, we move in many ways and that's what brings us to new, fantastic places!
                </p><br>
                <p>Although I'm a rookie you should not forget: what I lack in experience I will make up for with my enthousiasm!</p>
